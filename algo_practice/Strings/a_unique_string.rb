# Given a lowercase alphabet string s, determine whether it has all unique characters.

# Constraints : 0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s

# Example 1
# Input: s = "abcde"
# Output: true
# Explanation: All characters only occur once

# Example 2
# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: false
# Explanation: There's two as

# Example 3
# Input: s = ""
# Output: true
# Explanation: All characters occur once (of which there are none)

# SOLUTION
# Easy Level 
def solve(s)
       str_arr = s.split('')
       str_arr == str_arr.uniq ? true : false
