# Question: 
# Search for a given number in a sorted array, with unique elements, that has been rotated by some arbitrary number. 
# Return -1 if the number does not exist.

# Assume no duplicated in array 
# Linear search is not an acceptable solution.
# Try to solve the problem using binary search.

# Iterative Solution
# Runtime Complexity: Logarithmic, O(log n).
# Space Complexity: Constant 0(1)
